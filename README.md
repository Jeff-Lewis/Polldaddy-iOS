# Polldaddy for iOS #

This is the Polldaddy code moved from SVN in its last known good state.

## Configuration ##

The configuration of the Polldaddy API is set in the Configuration.plist file in the Resources directory.  This file is intentionally excluded from the repository in the .gitignore so that API keys are not added to the repo.  There is a Configuration-example.plist file in the project that shows the format for the Configuration.plist file.  Please create a Configuration.plist file with the appropriate API key and Url.
